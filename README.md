# JStetris
I decided to learn JavaScript by making this Tetris clone as my first JavaScript project.
Before making this project I had always thought that JavaScript was something that should
be avoided by all means. But after these few days of coding this instead of doing what I
should have done, I now think that JavaScript is definitely something I want to use a lot
more in the projects I do.
